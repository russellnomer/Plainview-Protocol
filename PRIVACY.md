## The Plainview Protocol — Privacy Disclosure

**Effective Date:** January 9, 2026  
**Version:** 6.18

## 1. Overview

The Plainview Protocol ("the Software") is committed to transparency about how we handle user data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### Session Data

The Protocol collects the following information during your session:
- **Affidavit Signatures:** When you sign the Affidavit of Integrity, we capture:
  - Your typed name
  - Timestamp of signature
  - SHA-256 hash binding your signature to the Code of Conduct version
- **Form Inputs:** Information you enter into FOIA request generators, FARA reports, and other tools
- **Session State:** Temporary data to maintain your browsing session

### No Persistent Storage

The Plainview Protocol does not maintain a database of user information. All session data is:
- Stored temporarily in your browser session
- Cleared when you close the application
- Not transmitted to external servers for permanent storage

## 3. AI Processing Disclosure

### Third-Party AI APIs

The Protocol uses AI systems for investigative analysis and content generation:
- **Grok (X.AI):** May be used for data analysis
- **Gemini (Google):** May be used for content generation
- **Replit AI:** Used in the development and operation of the platform

### Data Processed by AI

When you use features like the FARA Reporter or evidence analysis tools:
- User-submitted data may be processed by third-party AI models
- AI-generated responses are returned to you through the application
- We do not control how third-party AI providers handle data beyond their published policies

### User Responsibility

You are responsible for:
- Not submitting sensitive personal information through AI-powered features
- Reviewing AI-generated content before use
- Understanding that AI processing involves third-party systems

---

## 4. FOIA and Evidence Submissions

### User-Generated Content

When you generate FOIA requests, FARA reports, or ethics complaints:
- The generated documents are created locally in your session
- Downloaded files are stored on your own device
- The Protocol does not retain copies of your submissions

### Submission Tracking

The Protocol tracks aggregate statistics (e.g., "Total FOIA Requests Generated") but does not associate these with individual users.

---

## 5. Cookies and Tracking

### Session Cookies

The Protocol uses essential session cookies to:
- Maintain your session state
- Track your affidavit signature status
- Store your selected preferences (state, focus area)

### No Advertising or Analytics Tracking

We do not use:
- Third-party advertising cookies
- Cross-site tracking
- Analytics services that collect personal information

---

## 6. Data Security

### Encryption

- All data transmitted to and from the Protocol uses HTTPS encryption
- SHA-256 hashing is used for signature verification

### No Password Storage

The Protocol does not require user accounts or store passwords.

---

## 7. Your Rights

### Access and Deletion

Since we do not store persistent user data:
- There is no user data to access or delete
- Clearing your browser session removes all Protocol-related data

### Opt-Out

You may opt out of AI processing by:
- Not using AI-powered features
- Generating documents manually using the provided templates

## 8. Children's Privacy

The Plainview Protocol is not intended for use by individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. The effective date at the top of this page indicates when the policy was last revised.

---

## 10. IP Address Collection

When you sign the Affidavit of Integrity:
- Your session may capture timestamp and signature data
- We do not actively collect or store IP addresses
- Standard web server logs may temporarily contain IP addresses as part of normal operations
