# 🔱 Fork the Mission: The Decentralized Sentinel Network

## The Vision

The Plainview Protocol was never meant to be a single point of failure. Democracy doesn't live on one server. It lives in the hearts and hard drives of every citizen who refuses to look away.

This repository is **open source by design**. We don't just tolerate forks—we *demand* them.

---

## Why Fork?

### 1. **Redundancy is Resilience**
If this instance goes offline—whether by legal pressure, technical failure, or coordinated attack—your fork keeps the mission alive. Every fork is a backup. Every backup is a bulwark.

### 2. **Local Expertise Matters**
You know your county better than any algorithm. Fork the Protocol. Add your local FOIA endpoints. Map your county's no-bid contracts. You are the Sentinel your community needs.

### 3. **Censorship Resistance**
Information wants to be free. When you fork, you create a mirror that's harder to silence. 3,143 counties. 3,143 potential forks. Try shutting that down.

## How to Fork

### Step 1: Click the Fork Button
On the Replit project page or GitHub, hit "Fork." That's it. You now have your own copy.

### Step 2: Customize for Your Region
- Update `sources.json` with your state's specific FOIA endpoints
- Add your county's comptroller and budget URLs to `county_portals.json`
- Modify the `STATE_CORRUPTION_DATA` in `app.py` with local investigative findings

### Step 3: Deploy Your Node
Host it on Replit, Vercel, Netlify, or your own server. The Protocol doesn't care where you run it—only that you run it.

### Step 4: Register Your Fork (Optional)
Submit a PR to the main repository adding your fork to the **Sentinel Network Registry**. This helps other citizens find region-specific instances.

## The Sentinel's Oath

If you fork this project, you inherit the mission. That means:

- **Truth Over Tribalism**: We scrutinize Red and Blue equally. No sacred cows.
- **Evidence Over Emotion**: Every claim needs a documentary source.
- **Kindness in Delivery**: We rewrite accusations into questions. We seek correction, not destruction.
- **Free Forever**: No paywalls. No premium tiers. The people's data belongs to the people.

## The 5 Pillars of Evidentiary Integrity

Borrowed from the GAO 2024 Yellow Book (GAGAS):

1. **Documentary Primacy**: If you can't cite it, don't claim it.
2. **Hearsay Hierarchy**: Primary sources > Secondary sources > Never anonymous tips alone.
3. **Chain of Custody**: Original documents. Screenshots with metadata. Timestamped captures.
4. **Adverse Inference**: If they refuse to answer, document the refusal. Silence speaks.
5. **Revision Logging**: All Protocol updates are version-controlled and auditable.

---

## Technical Stack

The Protocol runs on:
- **Python 3.11** + **Streamlit** (web framework)
- **PostgreSQL** (forensic logging)
- **Plotly** (interactive charts)
- **Requests + lxml** (API calls, HTML parsing)

No exotic dependencies. No vendor lock-in. Fork-friendly by design.

---

## The Network Effect

Imagine:
- A fork in every state capital
- A fork for every major city
- A fork maintained by every journalism school
- A fork in every Veterans of Foreign Wars post
- A fork on every campus with a student press

**3,143 counties. 3,143 lighthouses. One mission.**

---

## Legal Shield

Every fork inherits our legal framework:
- `TERMS.md` — AS-IS warranty, use at your own risk
- `PRIVACY.md` — AI disclosure, data handling transparency  
- `SAFE_HARBOR.md` — 72-hour correction window for agencies
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — The 5 Pillars

You may modify these for your jurisdiction, but the spirit must remain: *Truth with kindness. Scrutiny without malice. Evidence above all.*

## Final Word

They thought they could hide behind paperwork. They thought citizens would never learn to read the contracts. They thought complexity was their shield.

They were wrong.

Fork the mission. Hold the line.

**The sun is rising, and it's time to work.**
