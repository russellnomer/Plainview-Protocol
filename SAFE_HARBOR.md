# Safe Harbor Statement

## The Plainview Protocol — Good-Faith Safe Harbor

**Effective Date:** January 9, 2026  
**Version:** 6.18

---

## Statement of Purpose

**The Plainview Protocol operates under a Good-Faith Safe Harbor. We invite all government agencies to participate in the "Accuracy Loop" to ensure the public record is precise.**

We are not adversaries. We are data partners committed to transparency and accuracy.

---

## The 3 Pillars of Collaboration

### Pillar 1: Good-Faith Immunity

The Protocol offers a **72-hour "Accuracy Window."**

If an agency identifies a factual error in a posted record, they can submit a Correction Request through our Agency Collaboration Portal. We pledge to:
- Review the correction request within 24 hours
- Update or retract the data immediately upon verification
- Document the correction in our public audit trail

This process preempts the need for litigation and demonstrates our commitment to accuracy.

### Pillar 2: Interoperability Access

We provide a dedicated **Agency Portal** where public records officers can:
- Verify their data's "Chain of Custody"
- Ensure that AI-generated summaries remain consistent with original source documents
- Submit official corrections with supporting documentation
- Request pre-publication review of pending releases (within reason)

### Pillar 3: Conflict Resolution Protocol

Before any Litigation Trigger or FARA Report is finalized, the Protocol can generate a **"Pre-Action Notice"** to the target agency, allowing for:
- Informal review of the evidence
- Identification of factual disputes
- Resolution without court costs
- Collaborative correction of the public record

## Affirmative Defense Procedures

The Plainview Protocol's Safe Harbor is modeled on the 2024-2026 State Safe Harbor Statutes:

### Ohio Model (2024)
Organizations that follow recognized data security frameworks and engage in proactive transparency receive qualified immunity from certain liability claims.

### Utah Model (2025)
Entities demonstrating "reasonable cybersecurity practices" and "good faith disclosure" are entitled to affirmative defense in data-related litigation.

### Connecticut Model (2026)
Organizations maintaining "proactive correction mechanisms" and "stakeholder engagement channels" qualify for safe harbor protections.

## The "Verified by Agency" Badge

Documents that have been reviewed or corrected through agency collaboration receive a special badge:

✅ **Verified by Agency** — This record has been reviewed by the relevant public records officer and confirmed or corrected for accuracy.

This badge:
- Increases public trust in the data
- Demonstrates agency engagement
- Creates a collaborative audit trail

---

## Legal Framework

### Good-Faith Standard

The Plainview Protocol maintains a "Good-Faith Standard" by:
- Inviting corrections before publication where feasible
- Responding promptly to agency concerns
- Documenting all correction requests and responses
- Maintaining transparent audit trails

### Reasonable Effort Defense

By publicly inviting agencies to correct data, the Protocol demonstrates:
- Absence of malicious intent
- Commitment to accuracy over sensationalism
- Reasonable efforts to obtain correct information
- Openness to collaborative fact-finding

## Founder's Litigation Preemption Note

> *"We aren't here to play 'Gotcha.' We're here to get it right. If the government wants to help us clean the data, the door is open. If they'd rather fight in court, we have the Cannon ready. Collaboration is the shorter path to the light."*

---

## Contact for Agency Collaboration

Government officials may initiate collaboration through:
- The Agency Collaboration Portal (within the application)
- GitHub issues on the official repository
- Direct contact through official .gov channels

This Safe Harbor statement describes our operational policies and does not constitute legal advice or create binding legal obligations beyond those established by applicable law.
