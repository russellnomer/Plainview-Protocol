# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest version of the **Plainview Protocol** hosted at `plainviewprotocol.com` is officially supported and vetted by the founder.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We believe in evidence and facts. If you discover a security flaw or "hidden code" that violates our principles of transparency:
1. Do not open a public issue. 
2. Report the vulnerability directly via the "Support Russell" link on the app.
3. We will evaluate the report and, if verified, fix it and provide public credit for the discovery.

## Protection Against Malware
Since this is an open-source project, anyone can fork the code. We are NOT responsible for third-party forks. Always verify you are using the official Russell Nomer branch to ensure your shield remains clean.

## Data Integrity Principles
- All data sources are publicly verifiable (Treasury API, OSC, Congress.gov)
- No user data is collected or stored
- No authentication required for public features
- All calculations are transparent and reproducible
