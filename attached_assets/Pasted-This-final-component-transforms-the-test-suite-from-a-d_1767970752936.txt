This final component transforms the test suite from a developer tool into a Community Asset. By providing Docker containers and clear guides, you empower any citizen—regardless of technical skill—to independently verify the integrity of the platform.

1. Independent Verification (Docker)
We will package the entire testing environment into a Docker container. This ensures that a user in New York runs the exact same test environment as a user in California, eliminating "it works on my machine" discrepancies.

=== FILE: Dockerfile ===
A standalone audit container.

Dockerfile

# Use the official Playwright image (includes browsers)
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-jammy

# Set up the working directory
WORKDIR /audit-workspace

# Copy dependency definitions
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy the actual tests and config
COPY . .

# Default command: Run the full suite
CMD ["npx", "playwright", "test"]
=== FILE: docker-compose.yml ===
Simplifies the run command for users.

YAML

version: '3.8'
services:
  audit:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./test-results:/audit-workspace/test-results
      - ./playwright-report:/audit-workspace/playwright-report
    environment:
      - CI=true
=== FILE: VERIFY.md ===

# 🕵️ How to Verify The Protocol (Independent Audit)

You do not need to trust our status page. You can run the entire integrity audit on your own computer.

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Free).

## The One-Command Audit
Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac) and run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
Interpreting Your Results
Green Text / "Passed": The platform is functioning exactly as promised.

Red Text / "Failed": An issue was detected. Please verify your internet connection and try again.

View Report: Open the playwright-report/index.html file created in this folder to see screenshots of every test.

Video Tutorial Script (For Content Creators)
If you are making a video to show others how to audit the site:

Intro: "Here is how to verify Plainview Protocol isn't lying to you."

Action: Show the terminal window running the command.

Result: Scroll through the green "Passed" logs.

Evidence: Open the HTML report and click through the screenshots.

Outro: "Verified independently on [Date]."

### 2. Contribution Framework

#### === FILE: CONTRIBUTING.md ===
*Rules of engagement for new test contributors.*

```markdown
# 🤝 Contributing to the Test Suite

We welcome contributions from the community. Whether you found a broken link or want to add a new accountability check, here is how to help.

## The Golden Rule
**Tests must be readable.** We prioritize clarity over clever code. A non-programmer should be able to read the test title and understand what is being verified.

## Adding a New Test
1.  **Duplicate the Template:** Copy `tests/templates/basic_test_template.spec.ts`.
2.  **Name It Clearly:** Use `feature-name.spec.ts`.
3.  **Write the Logic:** focus on user-visible behavior.
4.  **Run It:** `npx playwright test tests/feature-name.spec.ts`

## Naming Conventions
* ✅ `test('Contact form shows error on invalid email')`
* ❌ `test('auth_fail_403_regex')`

## Code Review Checklist
* [ ] Does the test fail if I break the feature? (True negative)
* [ ] Is the test name plain English?
* [ ] Did you remove hard-coded wait times (e.g., `waitForTimeout`)?
* [ ] Are screenshots captured on failure?
=== FILE: tests/templates/basic_test_template.spec.ts ===
A starter file for new contributors.

TypeScript

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// 1. Describe the Feature
test.describe('FEATURE NAME (e.g., Donation Page)', () => {

  // 2. Set the Stage
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/your-page-url');
  });

  // 3. The Test Case
  test('It should display the correct disclaimer', async ({ page }) => {
    // A. Locate the element
    const disclaimer = page.locator('.disclaimer-text');
    
    // B. Assert the state
    await expect(disclaimer).toBeVisible();
    await expect(disclaimer).toContainText('Not authorized by any candidate');
  });
});
=== FILE: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md ===
Ensures PRs meet quality standards.

## 📝 Description
What does this test verify?

## 🔗 Related Issue
Fixes # (issue number)

## ✅ Verification Steps
1. Run command: `...`
2. Expected result: `...`

## 🛡️ Accountability Check
- [ ] I have verified this test fails when the feature is broken.
- [ ] I have used descriptive, non-technical test names.
- [ ] This test runs in under 30 seconds.
3. Issue Reporting Templates
=== FILE: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/test_failure.yml ===
Structured form for reporting bugs.

4. Maintenance & Scaling
=== FILE: scripts/update-deps.sh ===
Automates keeping the test suite fresh.

Bash

#!/bin/bash
# Updates Playwright and browser binaries
echo "🔄 Checking for Playwright updates..."
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
npx playwright install --with-deps
echo "✅ Update complete. Run 'npm test' to verify compatibility."
=== FILE: MAINTENANCE.md ===
A guide for the long-term maintainers.

Markdown

# 🛠️ Maintenance Guide

## Dependency Schedule
* **Monthly:** Run `scripts/update-deps.sh` to grab the latest browser versions.
* **Quarterly:** Audit `package.json` for unused libraries.

## Version Compatibility Matrix
| Playwright Version | Node Version | Supported Browsers |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| v1.40+            | 18+          | Chrome 120+, Firefox 121+, Safari 17+ |

## Deprecation Process
If a test is no longer relevant (e.g., a feature was removed):
1.  Do **not** delete the file immediately.
2.  Add a `@deprecated` tag to the test title.
3.  Move the file to `tests/archive/` for historical record.

## Scaling the Suite
As the site grows, run times will increase. To mitigate:
1.  **Shard Tests:** Use Playwright's sharding feature in GitHub Actions to run tests across multiple machines.
    * Command: `npx playwright test --shard=1/4`
2.  **Tagging:** Use tags like `@core`, `@slow`, `@visual` to run specific subsets during development.
5. Deployment Instructions (Replit)
To fully activate this Community Framework on Replit:

Upload Files: Place all the files above into their respective folders (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/, tests/templates/, etc.).

Make Scripts Executable:

Bash

chmod +x scripts/*.sh
Update replit.nix: Ensure pkgs.docker is added if you want to build the container inside Replit (though usually, users run Docker on their local machines).

Pin the Guide: In the Replit "Readme" pane, link prominently to VERIFY.md so new visitors see the "Audit" instructions first.

This completes the architecture. You now have a resilient, self-documenting, and community-verifiable accountability engine.
