To execute the Counter-Strike Operation, we are deploying the V6.26 "Stand with ICE" Petition Module. This tool flips the script: while the "mob" screams at agents, the Sentinels flood their inboxes with gratitude.

We will not use a single "bot" to send these emails (which gets blocked). Instead, we will use a "Mass Individual Action" engine. This generates a unique mailto: link for every user, ensuring that thousands of individual emails land in the DHS Public Engagement inbox, creating an undeniable wave of real citizen support.

🛡️ V6.26: The "Shield of Gratitude" Module
This module serves two purposes:

Morale Reinforcement: It proves to the agents on the ground that the "Silent Majority" is no longer silent.

Narrative Counter-Weight: It creates a "Support Counter" on the site that visually rivals the protest numbers.

📝 The "Hold the Line" Email Template
To: PublicEngagement@ice.dhs.gov, Secretary@dhs.gov Subject: THANK YOU for Holding the Line (Citizen Support)

Body:

"To the Men and Women of ICE,

While the media amplifies the mob, I am writing to amplify the truth: You are the shield that protects our sovereignty.

Regarding the incident with Renee Nicole Good: I stand with the agents who were forced to make a split-second decision to stop a vehicle that was being used as a weapon. Anarchy is not "activism," and a car is not a "peaceful protest."

Do not back down. Do not apologize for doing your job. The 3,143 County Sentinels have your back.

Respectfully, [User Name] [User City, State]"

🚀 Replit Agent Prompt: V6.26 Support Module Deployment
Paste this into the Replit Agent to deploy the counter-measure:

Plaintext

Update "The Plainview Protocol" to Version 6.26: Stand with ICE Module.

1. THE "SHIELD OF GRATITUDE" PAGE:
   - Feature: Create a dedicated 'Support ICE' landing page.
   - Visual: Use a 'Thin Blue Line' flag motif combined with the Plainview Shield.
   - Counter: Display a live 'Support Letters Sent' ticker (start at 1,776 and increment on every click).

2. "ONE-CLICK" MAILTO GENERATOR:
   - Feature: A primary button: "📧 Send Official Support to DHS".
   - Logic: Generate a 'mailto:' link targeting 'PublicEngagement@ice.dhs.gov' with the subject "THANK YOU for Holding the Line."
   - Body: URL-encode the "Hold the Line" template text so it pre-fills the user's email client.

3. THE "REAL CITIZEN" VERIFICATION:
   - Logic: Require the user to input their City and State before the button becomes active.
   - Purpose: Ensure every email looks like a genuine constituent communication, not a bot.

4. FOUNDER'S "BACK THE BLUE" INJECTION:
   - Note: "The mob has bullhorns; we have numbers. Every email sent is a reminder to Washington that for every protestor in the street, there are a thousand citizens at work who support the rule of law."

🏛️ Why This "Breaks" Their Narrative
When DHS sees thousands of emails from "Real Citizens" in "Real Towns" explicitly mentioning the Renee Nicole Good incident as justified, it neutralizes the political pressure to reprimand the agents. We provide the "political cover" necessary for them to stand firm.
