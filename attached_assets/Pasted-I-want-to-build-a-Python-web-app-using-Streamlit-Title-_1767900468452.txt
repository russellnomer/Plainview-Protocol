I want to build a Python web app using Streamlit. Title: "The Plainview Protocol: Truth, Kindness, & Security"

The app educates citizens on policy costs (e.g., border gaps, fraud, immunity shields) and helps voice concerns kindly. Tone: Objective, pro-American, rule of law, domestic security focus.

Sidebar navigation with three pages:

Page 1: The Local Lens (Your Wallet Impact)
- Header: "How Federal Costs Hit Home in Plainview"
- Inputs: Number input "Estimated Annual Federal Taxes Paid" (default: 15000), text input "County" (default: "Nassau County, NY")
- Calculations (prototype ratios):
  - Debt Interest Share: 18% (2026 projection: interest ~$1T annually)
  - Waste/Policy Gap Share: 5% (including unchecked burdens like $150.7B net annual immigration cost per FAIR/House reports)
- Display as st.metric: "Your Share to Debt Interest: $X", "Your Share to Waste/Gaps: $Y"
- Text: "This could fund local roads, schools, or security. Accountability protects taxpayer dollars and America's future."

Page 2: The 2027 Fork in the Road (Future Outlook)
- Header: "Two Paths Ahead: Crisis or Reform"
- Use plotly or st.line_chart: Debt-to-GDP % (2024-2030, hard-coded points)
  - Red (Status Quo): Sharp rise e.g. [100, 105, 112, 120, 130, 140]
  - Blue (Accountability): Flattens e.g. [100, 102, 104, 105, 106, 107]
- Table: "Immunity Double Standard"
  - Columns: "Scenario", "Average Citizen Consequence", "Shielded Official Consequence"
  - Rows:
    1. Fraud/Enabling Fraud -> Fines/Prison/Seizure -> Often Protected by Immunity
    2. Public-Harming Negligence -> Full Liability -> Frequently Dismissed
- Text: "Equal rule of law restores trust, saves billions, secures borders."

Page 3: The Bridge Builder (Effective Voice)
- Header: "Turn Concern into Impact"
- Text area: "Share thoughts here (e.g., borders, fraud, immunity, costs):"
- Button: "Rewrite Professionally & Kindly"
- On click: Python function rewrite
  - Keyword swaps: e.g., angry terms ("destroying", "idiots", "liars", swears) -> "negligent", "leaders", "violating trust", "deeply concerned"
  - Focus: Facts on security, taxpayer impact, rule of law
  - Append: "I respectfully urge enforcement of laws and accountability to protect America's domestic interests and future."
  - Show in expander/box for copy-paste.

General:
- Patriotic accents: Blue/red/white, clean layout.
- Footer: "Built by Russell Nomer in Plainview, NY – Kindness, truth, secure America."
- requirements.txt: streamlit, pandas, plotly
