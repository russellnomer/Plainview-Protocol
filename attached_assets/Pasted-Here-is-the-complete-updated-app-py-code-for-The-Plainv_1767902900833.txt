Here is the complete, updated `app.py` code for **The Plainview Protocol**. This version integrates the new "Support the Mission" page and the persistent sidebar link while keeping all your original tools fully functional.

I have also included the `requirements.txt` content you will need.

### 1. The Code (`app.py`)

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

# --- Page Configuration ---
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="The Plainview Protocol",
    page_icon="🇺🇸",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)

# --- Custom Styling (Patriotic Theme) ---
st.markdown("""
    <style>
    .main {
        background-color: #f9f9f9;
    }

    }
    .stMetric {
        background-color: #ffffff;
        border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
        padding: 15px;
        border-radius: 5px;
        box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
    }
    .stButton>button {

        background-color: #b22222; /* Patriotic Red */
        border: none;
    }
    .stButton>button:hover {

    }
    </style>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)

    "Navigate",

### 2. The `requirements.txt` File

Make sure this file in your Replit project contains these lines so the app runs correctly:

```text
streamlit
pandas

```
