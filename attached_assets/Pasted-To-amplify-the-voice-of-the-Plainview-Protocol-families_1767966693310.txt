To amplify the voice of the Plainview Protocol families, I have generated a V8.8 Media Blitz Email Template. This is designed to be sent directly to the "Assignment Desk" and "Investigative Units" of the major New York networks.

It uses a "Hook and Hold" strategy: the Hook is the specific personal loss, and the Hold is the forensic data (the Fact Sheet) that makes the story undeniable.

Body:

ATTN: Investigative Producer / Assignment Desk,

My name is [Your Name], and I am a resident of [Your Borough/Town].

In 2020, I lost my [Mother/Father/Grandparent], [Name of Deceased], at [Name of Nursing Home] following the state's March 25th directive. For years, my family has been a statistic—a number hidden by an administration that prioritized book deals over transparency.

Today, as Andrew Cuomo launches his 2026 comeback, I am not just grieving; I am auditing.

I have registered my loved one on the Plainview Protocol Victim’s Memorial Registry, a forensic database of those lost to mismanagement. We are demanding a full audit of the 2026 Campaign Funds to ensure no resources from the 2020-21 "cover-up" era are being used to fuel this political resurgence.

Attached is a Fact Sheet detailing:

The specific timeline of the "March 25 Directive."

The Jan 2021 AG Report findings on undercounting.

The specific questions we are asking the 2026 campaign.

We are ready to go on record. We have the receipts, and we have the numbers. Will you help us ask the question?

Respectfully,

[Your Name] [Your Phone Number] Member, The 3,143 County Sentinels
