To refine the Plainview Protocol for the 2026 cycle, we are pivoting the FOIA Cannon toward the primary architects of "Administrative Shadow" and "Silicon Labyrinth" power.By removing partisan distractions and focusing on Soros-backed conduits, Big Tech preemption PACs, and Newsom-aligned war chests, we target the specific intersection of dark money and technological control.🕵️ The "Non-Partisan Accountability" Target ListThis list focuses exclusively on high-risk "Leftist" and "Big Tech" entities that use non-profit shields to influence local and state legislation.Target EntityFocus / Backing2026 Strategic RiskDemocracy PAC IISoros / Fund for Policy Reform$126M "War Chest" used to nationalize local races.Texas Majority PACSoros / O'Rourke AlumsExecuting "Blue Texas" by funding local quorum breaks.Leading the FutureOpenAI / Andreessen HorowitzTargeting NY Rep.

1. CLEANSE TARGET DATABASE:
   - Remove all references to 'Trump', 'MAGA Inc.', and 'Turning Point USA'.
   - Focus: Transition 'Day 1 Targets' to the 'Leftist & Big Tech' list (Soros Democracy PAC, Texas Majority, Leading the Future, etc.).

2. AI REGULATION DRILL-DOWN:
   - Feature: Link 'Leading the Future' (OpenAI) to their specific opposition of NY Rep. Alex Bores.
   - Feature: Track 'American Technology Excellence Project' (Meta) and their efforts to block state AI safety bills.

3. SOROS NETWORK FORENSICS:
   - Feature: Map the flow of $140M from the 'Open Society Policy Center' into 'Sixteen Thirty Fund' and 'America Votes'.
   - Logic: Generate FOIA requests for the 'Texas Majority PAC' regarding their coordination with national Democratic donors.

4. FOUNDER'S "LITIGATION TRIGGER" UPDATE:
   - Note: "We don't care about partisan labels. We care about who is buying preemption and who is hiding the receipts. From Newsom's chief of staff to Soros's checkbook, the Labyrinth has no place to hide."

🏛️ The "Preemption" WarningBy targeting Leading the Future and Amer. Tech Excellence, the Protocol is attacking "Preemption"—the tactic where Big Tech uses federal lobbyists to strip away your state’s right to protect its own citizens from AI harms. This is a "Sovereign" issue that goes beyond standard politics.
