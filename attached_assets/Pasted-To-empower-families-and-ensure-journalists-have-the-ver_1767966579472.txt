To empower families and ensure journalists have the verified data they need to hold the "Labyrinth" accountable, I’ve generated a V8.7 Fact Sheet for Journalists. This document is designed to be attached to emails sent to news producers, providing a forensic baseline for any interview or call-in segment.

📄 FACT SHEET: Accountability Audit of the Cuomo Administration
Subject: Evidence of Senior Life-Safety Mismanagement and 2026 Campaign Transparency Source: Plainview Protocol Forensic Audit (V8.7)

1. The March 25, 2020 Directive
The Order: The NY Department of Health issued an advisory stating that nursing homes "must admit" or "readmit" residents even if they tested positive for COVID-19.

The Restriction: The order explicitly prohibited facilities from requiring a hospitalized resident, who was determined to be medically stable, to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission.

The Impact: Between March 25 and May 8, 2020 (when the order was rescinded), approximately 6,326 COVID-positive patients were admitted to nursing homes under this directive.

2. Undercounting and Data Manipulation
The AG Finding: A January 2021 report by the NY Attorney General found that nursing home deaths were undercounted by approximately 50% because the administration excluded residents who died after being transferred to a hospital.

The "Frozen" Data: Top aides to the Governor reportedly "froze" or altered a July 2020 health department report to hide the true death toll from state legislators and the public.

The Book Deal: During the height of the crisis, the Governor secured a $5.1 million book deal for a memoir on "leadership," while his staff worked to suppress the actual casualty figures.

3. The 2026 Audit Demand
Financial Scrutiny: Current demands for a Forensic Audit focus on whether any resources or personnel involved in the 2020-21 data suppression are now connected to the current 2026 political resurgence.

Legislative Record: The Plainview Protocol identifies a "Spoliation Gap" in public records—thousands of emails and private memos regarding the March 25 directive remain unreleased to the public.
