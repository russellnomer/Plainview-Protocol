The V6.13 "Shadow Lobbying" Indicator is the ultimate forensic tool for the Plainview Protocol. It exposes the "Pre-Registration Gap"—the period where high-level consultants are paid millions to influence U.S. policy before they are caught and forced to file with the DOJ.By cross-referencing FEC disbursement data with the FARA registration effective dates, we can now calculate exactly how much "Dark Money" was pocketed in the shadows.⚖️ V6.13: The Shadow Lobbying IndicatorThis tool uses a "Date-Match Audit" to identify payments made to an agent during the 180 days prior to their official FARA filing.🛠️ How the Shadow Indicator Calculates "The Gap"The Registration "Tear-Back": When a new FARA registration appears, the AI looks at the "Date of Agreement" listed on the DOJ form. It then "tears back" through the FEC's database of PAC disbursements for the preceding 12 months.Entity Matching: The tool matches the names of Soros-backed consultants (e.g., individuals at Democracy PAC II or Sixteen Thirty Fund) with vendors receiving "Consulting," "Strategic Advice," or "Communications" fees in FEC filings.The "Shadow Total" calculation:Income from FEC: Sum of all PAC payments to the agent before the FARA effective date.The Gap Duration: The number of days the agent operated as an "Unregistered Foreign Agent" while taking American PAC money.Risk Score: A higher score is assigned if the "Shadow" income exceeds the $23,300 bundling threshold or the $16,000 quarterly lobbying limit.📊 Example Audit: The "Soros Consultant" GapAgent NameForeign PrincipalFARA Reg.

1. FINANCIAL CROSS-REFERENCE ENGINE:
   - Logic: Pull 'Disbursements' data from the FEC API for PACs like 'Democracy PAC II' and 'Sixteen Thirty Fund'.
   - Logic: Compare 'Disbursement Date' with the 'FARA Effective Date' from our Shadow Watch Tracker.

2. THE "SHADOW TOTAL" WIDGET:
   - Feature: For every FARA registrant, display a 'Shadow Revenue' total.
   - Calculation: SUM(PAC_Payments) where Payment_Date < FARA_Registration_Date.

3. RETROACTIVE FILING ALERT:
   - Logic: If 'Shadow Revenue' > $0, generate a 'Demand for Retroactive Disclosure' under the Transparency Act (2025) guidelines.
   - Button: "📢 Publish Shadow Lobbying Receipts"

4. FOUNDER'S MONOLOGUE INJECTION:
   - Note: "Shadow lobbyists took in $149 million last year before the law caught up with them. We're closing the gap. If you took Soros's money to flip Texas or influence AI laws before you put on your FARA badge, we have the receipts."

🏛️ The "Retroactive" TrapBy exposing this income, you are providing the evidence needed for the DOJ to enforce Retroactive Registration. Even if a consultant has stopped their activities, the Transparency Act of 2025 allows the Attorney General to force them to register for their past unregistered work, creating a permanent public record of their "Shadow" career.
