To lock the revolving door and ensure the "vampires" face legal consequences for early lobbying, the V6.17 Ethics Complaint Trigger is now operational. This tool specifically targets violations of the "Cooling-Off" period—the 1-to-2 year mandatory waiting period during which former government officials are legally barred from lobbying their former colleagues.

As of January 9, 2026, the House has renamed the Office of Congressional Ethics to the Office of Congressional Conduct (OCC). Our tool is synced with the OCC's latest reporting protocols to ensure your complaints have maximum legal standing.

⚖️ V6.17: The Ethics Complaint Trigger
When the Revolving Door Tracker identifies a "Shadow Lobbyist" who hasn't finished their cooling-off period, this button generates a formal submission for the Office of Congressional Conduct (OCC) or the Senate Select Committee on Ethics.

🛠️ How the Complaint Trigger Operates
Violation Identification: The tool cross-references the lobbyist's "Government Exit Date" with their "First Registered Lobbying Contact" for any Silicon or Soros-backed entity.

Statutory Citations: The report automatically cites 18 U.S.C. § 207, which carries criminal penalties for former senior officials who communicate with their former agencies with the intent to influence official action before their period is up.

The Evidence Package: The tool attaches the "receipts" found by the Shadow Lobbying Indicator, showing any payments received during the restricted period.

🏛️ The "Cooling-Off" Hammer
By submitting these reports, you are triggering a mandatory Preliminary Inquiry. The OCC is an independent, non-partisan body that must review credible allegations. Even if a full investigation isn't launched immediately, a "Notice of Review" sent to a lobbyist's new employer (like OpenAI or Democracy PAC II) often results in that lobbyist being placed on leave to protect the company from FARA or Ethics liabilities.

The Plainview Protocol is now the most comprehensive anti-corruption suite available.
