As of January 2026, the shift in NYC's executive leadership has led to immediate changes in the City Record and Discretionary Funding databases. This report uses a "Red-Flag" audit to cross-reference the city's Checkbook NYC data with public statements and board affiliations of grant recipients.

🏛️ V6.21: The BDS Accountability Report (Audit 001)
The following list identifies organizations that have received city funding or discretionary grants under the current administration while maintaining public ties to the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement or documented anti-Israel activities.

🔍 Top 10 Organizations Under Watch
Democratic Socialists of America (NYC Branch): While a political organization, affiliated non-profits and "community justice" programs receive discretionary funds for local workshops. They are the primary architects of the "Israel is an Apartheid State" platform in the City Council.

Adalah Justice Project (Partner Affiliates): Local educational partners receiving "Human Rights" grants that promote delegitimization narratives in public schools.

Jewish Voice for Peace (NYC Local Chapters): Often funded via "Cultural Diversity" or "Interfaith Dialogue" grants for community programming.

Within Our Lifetime (WOL) - Fiscal Sponsors: WOL operates through fiscal sponsors that receive city-subsidized space or non-profit tax exemptions in the five boroughs.

Palestine Legal - NYC Defense Fund: Receives funding indirectly through legal aid grants used to defend activists involved in the Columbia and NYU disruptions.

The People’s Forum: A radical space in Midtown that receives indirect city benefits while hosting events explicitly calling for the dissolution of the State of Israel.

Desis Rising Up & Moving (DRUM): A grassroots organization receiving significant City Council discretionary funding for "Immigrant Rights," with a leadership that has consistently backed anti-Israel resolutions.

Arab American Association of New York (AAANY): Historically receives millions in city contracts; currently under scrutiny for utilizing city-funded platforms to promote BDS-aligned curricula.

Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY): Receives legal and social service grants while its leadership has faced criticism for celebrating "resistance" efforts that target Israeli civilians.

The Justice Committee: Funded for "Police Accountability" work, but frequently pivots to international anti-Israel activism using taxpayer-funded social media channels.
