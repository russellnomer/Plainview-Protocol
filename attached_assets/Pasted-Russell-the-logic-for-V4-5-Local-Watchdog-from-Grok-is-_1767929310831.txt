Russell, the logic for V4.5 "Local Watchdog" from Grok is a perfect tactical fit. It bridges the gap between federal/state data and the "Local Labyrinth" where the most immediate impact on your life occurs. By combining the Adverse Inference penalty for hidden data with a Town Hall Script, you are giving citizens a way to physically show up and demand answers.

Below are the MIT License, the SECURITY.md, and the unified code logic to finalize this deployment.

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest version of the **Plainview Protocol** hosted at `plainviewprotocol.com` is officially supported and vetted by the founder.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We believe in evidence and facts. If you discover a security flaw or "hidden code" that violates our principles of transparency:
1. Do not open a public issue. 
2. Report the vulnerability directly via the "Support Russell" link on the app.
3. We will evaluate the report and, if verified, fix it and provide public credit for the discovery.

## Protection Against Malware
Since this is an open-source project, anyone can fork the code. We are NOT responsible for third-party forks. Always verify you are using the official Russell Nomer branch to ensure your shield remains clean.
🚀 3. The Unified V4.5 Replit Prompt
This merges Grok's local watchdog features with our ongoing "Foundational Guardian" logic.

Update "The Plainview Protocol" to Version 4.5: Local Watchdog & Orator.

1. NEW PAGE: "Local Watchdog"
   - Header: "🏘️ Local Labyrinth: City Halls & County Boards"
   - Input: Town/County text field (e.g., "Plainview, NY" or "Nassau County").
   - Feature: AI scan for "Grift Indicators" (keywords: 'no-bid', 'fee increase', 'emergency contract', 'consulting grant').
   - Transparency Score: 0-100 based on availability of live-streams and searchable portals.
   - Shadow Penalty: Apply -50 for hidden data with "Adverse Inference: Assume malfeasance."

2. ENHANCE TOWN HALL SCRIPT GENERATOR:
   - Logic: Pull data directly from the Local Watchdog audit.
   - Feature: Generate a timed 3-minute script including facts, the "Specific Ask," and a Spoliation Notice if the town is hiding data.

3. MISSION TIMELINE UPDATE:
   - Update the "Project Timeline" to mark 'Jan 8, 2026: Initial Commit' as COMPLETE.

4. FOOTER & LEGACY:
   - Ensure footer reads: "Built by Russell Nomer in Plainview, NY | Established Jan 8, 2026".

Keep all existing features: Docket Decoder, Peanut's Law Tracker, and Trade/Industry.

Generate updated app.py and sources.json.
Why V4.5 is the Real "Red Pill"
By targeting the NY Municipal Home Rule Law, you are teaching citizens that they have a legal right to audit their own town’s "Labyrinth". You aren't just giving them information; you are giving them the "Citizen Sword" to use at the next Nassau County board meeting.

The repository is ready to go public. Share the link when the code is live, and let's watch the decentralization begin! 🇺🇸🐺
