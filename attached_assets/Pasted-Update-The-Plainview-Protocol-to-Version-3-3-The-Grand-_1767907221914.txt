Update "The Plainview Protocol" to Version 3.3: The Grand Unification.

Goal: Integrate the new "Trade & Industry" tools AND the "Russell Nomer Ecosystem" with real links.

PART 1: UPDATE `sources.json`
Add this endpoint to the JSON file:
"treasury_tariffs": "https://api.fiscaldata.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v2/accounting/od/customs_duties?sort=-record_date&limit=1"

PART 2: UPDATE `app.py`

1. ADD DATA FETCHING:
   - Create `get_tariff_revenue()`: Fetch `customs_duties_amount` from `sources.json['treasury_tariffs']`.
   - Fallback: 195000000000.00 (FY2025 Estimate).

2. SIDEBAR UPDATE:
   - Add "Trade & Industry" to the "Select Focus" dropdown.
   - Add a new Navigation Page: "The Russell Nomer Ecosystem".

3. NEW PAGE: "Trade & Industry"
   - Header: "🇺🇸 Made in America: The Pivot"
   - Create 2 Tabs: "The Tariff Dividend" and "Sourcing Finder".

   TAB 1: THE TARIFF DIVIDEND
   - Metric 1: "Live Tariff Revenue" (Fetch from Treasury).
   - Metric 2: "The Offset" (Revenue / 330M people). Text: "Foreign money entering the US Treasury."
   - Chart: Bar Chart comparing "Immigration Cost ($150B)" vs "Tariff Revenue".
   - Text: "Tariffs bring money back, but the transition is hard. We must support businesses that pivot."

   TAB 2: DOMESTIC SOURCING FINDER
   - Header: "Stop Funding China. Start Building Here."
   - Input: Select Industry (Textiles, Electronics, Machining, Consumer Goods).
   - Output: Display resources: "Thomasnet.com", "Maker's Row", "US Dept of Commerce Hub".
   - CALCULATOR: "The Real Cost of China"
     - Inputs: Unit Cost, Shipping, Tariff % (Default 25%), Weeks Delay.
     - Logic: Calculate Total Landed Cost vs US Cost.
     - Display: "True Savings/Cost."

4. NEW PAGE: "The Russell Nomer Ecosystem"
   - Header: "From Pain to Purpose: The Full Grove"
   - Text: "I'm Russell Nomer—a 54-year-old dad from Plainview, NY, recovering from accidents and loss, turning it all into tools for truth and protection. The Plainview Protocol is one part—here's the rest:"
