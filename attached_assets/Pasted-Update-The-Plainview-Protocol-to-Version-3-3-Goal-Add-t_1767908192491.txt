Update "The Plainview Protocol" to Version 3.3.

Goal: Add the "Russell Nomer Ecosystem" page AND a "Trade & Industry" section that helps businesses pivot from China to US manufacturing with empathy and facts.

PART 1: UPDATE `sources.json`
Add this endpoint to the JSON file:
"treasury_tariffs": "https://api.fiscaldata.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v2/accounting/od/customs_duties?sort=-record_date&limit=1"

PART 2: UPDATE `app.py`

1. ADD DATA FETCHING:
   - Create `get_tariff_revenue()`: Fetch `customs_duties_amount` from `sources.json['treasury_tariffs']`.
   - Fallback: 195000000000.00.

2. NEW SIDEBAR NAVIGATION:
   - Add "Trade & Industry" and "The Russell Nomer Ecosystem" to the navigation list.

3. NEW PAGE: "Trade & Industry"
   - Header: "🇺🇸 Made in America: The Pivot"
   - Create 2 Tabs: "The Tariff Dividend" and "Domestic Sourcing Finder".

   TAB 1: THE TARIFF DIVIDEND
   - Metric 1: "Live Tariff Revenue" (Fetch from Treasury).
   - Metric 2: "The Plainview Dividend" (Revenue / 330M people).
   - Chart: Bar Chart "Immigration Cost ($150B)" vs "Tariff Revenue".
   - Text: "Tariffs capture value from foreign markets to fund American strength."

   TAB 2: DOMESTIC SOURCING FINDER (The Empathy Engine)
   - Header: "The Pivot: Source Locally, Save Globally"
   - Text: "Transitioning is hard, but American resilience pays off. Here are vetted US resources to replace Chinese supply chains."
   - Input: Select Industry (Dropdown: General, Electronics, Textiles/Apparel, Consumer Goods).
   - Logic: Display specific resources based on selection:
     - *General:* "Thomasnet.com", "US Dept of Commerce Supply Chain Hub".
     - *Electronics:* "Circuits Assembly Directory", "Reshoring Institute".
     - *Textiles:* "Maker's Row", "American Blanket Company".
     - *Consumer:* "Wholesale Central", "TopTenWholesale (USA Section)".
   - CALCULATOR: "Total Landed Cost"
     - Inputs: Unit Cost, Shipping, Tariff % (Default 25%), Lead Time (Weeks).
     - Output: Compare "China Total" vs "USA Total".
     - Note: "Don't forget the cost of your time. 6 weeks on a boat costs money."

4. NEW PAGE: "The Russell Nomer Ecosystem"
   - Header: "From Pain to Purpose: The Full Grove"
   - Text: "I'm Russell Nomer—recovering from loss, building tools for truth. Join the Grove."
   - LINKS (Use st.link_button):
