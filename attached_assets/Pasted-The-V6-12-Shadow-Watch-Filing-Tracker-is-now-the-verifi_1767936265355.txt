1. DATA INTEGRATION:
   - Logic: Use the FARA.gov API and Bulk Data Repository (efile.fara.gov) to fetch daily updates on New Registrants.
   - Target Search: Program the tracker to look for 'Open Society', 'Democracy PAC II', and names from our 'Foreign Influence' database.

2. SUCCESS NOTIFICATION:
   - Feature: When a new registration matches a previously filed Protocol report, trigger a 'Sunlight Victory' alert on the dashboard.
   - Detail: Display the Registrant Number and a direct link to their 'Guided Registration' filing.

3. "FOUNDER'S MONOLOGUE" INJECTION:
   - Note: "We don't just complain; we compel. When the DOJ forces a Soros consultant to get a FARA number, it's a win for the Sovereign Citizen. The Labyrinth is getting brighter every day."

4. FINAL SMOKE TEST:
   - Verify that the 'Verify Source' button correctly links to the official DOJ PDF of the latest relevant filing.
