Update "The Plainview Protocol" to Version 3.5: Sunlight & Shadow Edition.

Goal: Expand accountability to State/Local levels (Governors, Mayors) and implement a "Shadow Penalty" for officials who hide their data.

PART 1: ARCHITECTURE UPDATE (`sources.json`)
Add these new placeholders for State-Level Data:
{
  "legiscan_api": "https://api.legiscan.com/?key=TEST", 
  "open_states": "https://v3.openstates.org/"
}

PART 2: NEW SCORING LOGIC (`app.py`)

1. THE "ADVERSE INFERENCE" ENGINE:
   - Create a function `calculate_transparency_score(visible_votes, total_sessions)`:
   - Logic: 
     - If `visible_votes` / `total_sessions` < 50%: Apply "Shadow Penalty" (-50 Points).
     - Label: "⚠️ DATA WITHHELD (Adverse Inference Applied)".
     - Text: "This official hides more than they show. Under the Plainview Protocol, we assume hidden records contain betrayal."

2. PAGE UPDATE: "Leader Scorecard" -> "The Accountability Tribunal"
   - Add Filter: "Federal", "State (Governor/Leg)", "Local (Mayor/Sheriff)".
   
   - STATE LEVEL (Mockup for Prototype):
     - Create a dataset for Governors (e.g., NY, CA, FL, TX).
     - Column: "Veto Record" (Did they veto Border Security?).
     - Column: "Transparency Score" (Are their calendars public?).
   
   - LOCAL LEVEL (The "Warlord" Tracker):
     - Allow Users to "Add an Official" (Local input).
     - Checkbox: "Are voting records easily available online?"
     - If User checks "No": Auto-assign "Shadow Score: F-".
     - Display: "Status: HIDDEN. Presumed Hostile to Liberty."

3. TRANSPARENCY METHODOLOGY PAGE (New Tab in Scorecard):
   - Header: "How We Rate: The Spoliation Doctrine."
   - Text: "In law, 'Spoliation' means destroying evidence. If a politician hides their record, we do not give them the benefit of the doubt. We apply 'Adverse Inference'—we assume the missing data proves their guilt."
   - Chart: Pie Chart showing "Public Record" vs "The Shadow Gap".

4. MAINTAIN EXISTING FEATURES:
   - Keep Tariff Tracker, Watchdog, and Ecosystem.
   - Ensure "State Multiplier" applies to Governors (e.g., Border State Governors held to higher standard).
