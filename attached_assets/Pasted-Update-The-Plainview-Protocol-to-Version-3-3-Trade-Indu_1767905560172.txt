Update "The Plainview Protocol" to Version 3.3: Trade & Industry Edition.

Goal: Add a powerful new section that tracks Tariff Revenue (The "Dividend") and helps businesses pivot to US Manufacturing (The "Solution").

PART 1: UPDATE `sources.json`
Add this endpoint to the JSON file:
"treasury_tariffs": "https://api.fiscaldata.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v2/accounting/od/customs_duties?sort=-record_date&limit=1"

PART 2: UPDATE `app.py`

1. ADD DATA FETCHING:
   - Create `get_tariff_revenue()`: Fetch `customs_duties_amount` from `sources.json['treasury_tariffs']`.
   - Fallback: 195000000000.00 (FY2025 Estimate).

2. SIDEBAR UPDATE:
   - Add "Trade & Industry" to the "Select Focus" dropdown.

3. NEW PAGE: "Trade & Industry" (Add to Navigation)
   - Header: "🇺🇸 Made in America: The Pivot"
   - Create 2 Tabs: "The Tariff Dividend" and "Sourcing Finder".

   TAB 1: THE TARIFF DIVIDEND
   - Metric 1: "Live Tariff Revenue" (Fetch from Treasury).
   - Metric 2: "The Offset" (Revenue / 330M people). Text: "Foreign money entering the US Treasury."
   - Chart: Bar Chart comparing "Immigration Cost ($150B)" vs "Tariff Revenue".
   - Text: "Tariffs bring money back, but the transition is hard. We must support businesses that pivot."

   TAB 2: DOMESTIC SOURCING FINDER (The Solution)
   - Header: "Stop Funding China. Start Building Here."
   - Input: Select Industry (Textiles, Electronics, Machining, Consumer Goods).
   - Output: Display a curated list of resources based on selection (Hard-coded dictionary):
     - *All:* "Thomasnet.com (Industrial Sourcing)", "Maker's Row (Apparel/Furniture)".
     - *Electronics:* "Reshoring Institute", "Circuits Assembly Directory".
     - *General:* "US Dept of Commerce Supply Chain Hub".

   - THE "REAL COST" CALCULATOR (The Empathy Tool):
     - Create 2 Columns: "Importing from China" vs "Making in USA".
     - Inputs: "Unit Cost", "Shipping Cost", "Tariff Rate %" (Default 25%), "Weeks in Transit".
     - Logic: Calculate "Total Landed Cost" for China (Unit + Shipping + Tariff) vs USA (Unit + higher labor - no tariff - low shipping).
     - Display: "The True Cost Difference." Often, USA is closer than it looks when tariffs are added.

4. ACTIVISM UPDATE:
   - Add a template to "Bridge Builder": "Business Owner to Rep: Help me Reshore."
     - "I want to hire American. Use Tariff revenue to give tax credits to small businesses who switch to US suppliers."
