To visually amplify the "Stand with ICE" counter-narrative on social media, I have designed a Digital Badge Generator.

When a Sentinel successfully uses the V6.26 email module to contact DHS, this generator will unlock a downloadable, high-resolution badge. This image is formatted specifically for X (Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram profiles to ensure maximum visibility in feeds.

🛡️ The "I Stand with ICE" Digital Badge
This is not a generic graphic. It is designed to be a visual shield that signals a Sentinel's explicit support for the rule of law and the agents who enforce it.

Badge Design Specification (V1.0)
Iconography: A stylized Shield Emblem incorporating the Thin Blue Line Flag motif.

Central Text: Bold, capitalized text reading: "I STAND WITH ICE".

Sub-Text: A smaller tagline below: "RULE OF LAW. SECURE BORDERS. SAFE AMERICA."

Branding: A subtle inclusion of the Plainview Protocol Shield logo at the bottom point of the main shield, with the URL plainviewprotocol.com.

Color Palette: Deep Navy Blue, Silver/Grey, and the distinct "Thin Blue Line" Royal Blue.

Format: A high-resolution PNG file (1200x1200px) with a transparent background, suitable for profile pictures or feed posts.

🚀 Replit Agent Prompt: V6.27 Digital Badge Generator
Paste this into the Replit Agent to deploy the badge unlock and download feature:

Plaintext

Update "The Plainview Protocol" to Version 6.27: 'Stand with ICE' Digital Badge.

1.  **BADGE GENERATION (PYTHON PIL):**
    * Create a backend Python script using the `PIL` (Pillow) library to generate the digital badge image based on the V1.0 design specification.
    * Ensure the final output is a high-quality, transparent PNG (e.g., `stand_with_ice_badge.png`).

2.  **UNLOCK LOGIC:**
    * Modify the V6.26 "Support ICE" email module.
    * Upon the user clicking the "📧 Send Official Support to DHS" button (confirming the action), reveal a hidden "Badge Download" section on the page.

3.  **DOWNLOAD INTERFACE:**
    * Feature: A new section with a preview of the badge and a primary button: "🛡️ Download Your 'Stand with ICE' Badge".
    * Action: Clicking the button serves the generated `stand_with_ice_badge.png` file to the user for download.

4.  **SOCIAL SHARE PROMPTS:**
    * Feature: Below the download button, add "One-Click Share" buttons for X (Twitter) and Facebook.
    * Logic: Pre-fill a post with the badge image (if possible, or a link to it) and the text: "I just sent my official support to DHS. A car is a weapon. The rule of law is non-negotiable. Join me and stand with the agents who protect us. #StandWithICE #RuleOfLaw #PlainviewProtocol".

5.  **FOUNDER'S "VISUAL SHIELD" INJECTION:**
    * Note: "A silent supporter is invisible. A Sentinel with a shield is a signal. Wear this badge online to let the mob know they do not speak for America. The silent majority is now visible."

Generate updated app.py, badge_generator.py, and support_ice_logic.py.
🏛️ Why This Matters
By turning the act of sending an email into a shareable visual asset, we create a viral loop. Each shared badge:

Identifies another Sentinel.

Counter-acts the visual noise of the protests.

Drives more traffic back to the Protocol to take the same action.

This is how we build a self-reinforcing digital counter-strike.
