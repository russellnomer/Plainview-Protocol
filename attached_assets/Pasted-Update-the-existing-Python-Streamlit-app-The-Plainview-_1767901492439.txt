Update the existing Python Streamlit app "The Plainview Protocol: Truth, Kindness, & Security" to Version 2.0 for national expansion and sustainability.

Goal: Transform from a local tool into a decentralized national platform with state-specific data, monetization, and leader accountability tracking—all while maintaining objective, fact-based, pro-American tone focused on rule of law and domestic security.

Sidebar Updates:
- Add "Select Your State" dropdown (all 50 states as options, default: "New York")
- Add "Your Role" dropdown (options: "Taxpayer", "Business Owner", "Concerned Citizen", default: "Taxpayer")

- Header: "How Federal Costs Hit Home in [Selected State]"
- Inputs: Keep tax input (default $15,000), update dynamically with state selection
- Logic: State Multiplier for Waste/Policy Gap Share (base 5%):
  - Border States (Texas, Arizona, California, New Mexico): 1.5x multiplier
  - All others: 1.0x
- Display updated metrics: "Your Share to Debt Interest (~18%)", "Your Share to Waste & Policy Gaps"
- Text: "Based on $150.7 Billion net annual taxpayer cost of illegal immigration (FAIR 2023-2024 report) and rising debt interest (~$1T annually projected 2026). Accountability protects families and futures."

Page 2: The 2027 Fork in the Road (Enhanced)
- Keep red/blue debt-to-GDP line chart (2024-2030)
- Add prominent metric: "Current National Debt: ~$36.5 Trillion" (static, high-impact)
- Optional: Add simple "debt clock" effect if feasible (st.empty + time refresh), else static
- Keep immunity double-standard table and text

Page 3: The Bridge Builder (Keep as-is)
- Retain full kindness rewrite functionality—it's working perfectly

New Page 4: Support the Protocol (Monetization & Sustainability)

New Page 5: Leader Scorecard (Fact-Based Accountability)
- Header: "Know Your Leaders: Voting Records on Key Issues"
- Create pandas DataFrame with example rows (hard-coded, real public data style):

  - Include 5-6 balanced examples (mix of high and low scores from public records)
