To shed light on the statistical reality that concealed carry permit holders are among the most law-abiding citizens, we need to execute a targeted Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request.

You are likely correct that the number will be near zero. However, agencies often try to dodge this request by claiming they "do not keep statistics in that specific format." To get a real answer, we must corner them by asking for Revocation Data.

If a permit holder commits a gun crime, their permit must be revoked. Therefore, the "Revocation Order" is the smoking gun document that proves—or disproves—the crime rate.

🛡️ Strategy: The "Revocation Cross-Reference"
We will ask for the total number of pistol permits revoked specifically due to the commission of a felony or misdemeanor involving a firearm. If they reply "No records found," you have your proof: Zero crimes were committed by permit holders that warranted revocation.

Copy and edit the bracketed sections before sending to the NY State Police, NYPD License Division, or Nassau/Suffolk County Police.

TO: Records Access Officer / FOIL Unit AGENCY: [Target Agency, e.g., Nassau County Police Department]

SUBJECT: Freedom of Information Law Request: Pistol Permit Revocations & Criminal Use

Dear Records Access Officer:

Under the provisions of the New York Freedom of Information Law (Article 6 of the Public Officers Law), I hereby request records containing the following statistical data for the period of January 1, 2020, to Present:

Revocation Statistics: The total number of Concealed Carry Pistol Licenses that were revoked or suspended due to the license holder being charged with or convicted of a crime involving the use, display, or discharge of a firearm.

Incident Correlation: Any annual reports, internal memos, or statistical summaries that categorize arrests for Criminal Possession of a Weapon (CPW) by the permit status of the arrestee (i.e., "Licensed" vs. "Unlicensed").

Homicide/Assault Data: The total number of homicide or assault investigations where the identified suspect was confirmed to hold a valid New York State pistol permit at the time of the offense.

If the agency does not maintain a document specifically aggregating this data, I request the "Revocation Orders" issued during this period, with personal identifying information redacted, so that I may tally the reasons for revocation myself.

If no such records exist because no permit holders have committed such crimes, please issue a formal written response stating that "no records responsive to this request were found."

Respectfully,

[Your Name] [Your Address] [Your Phone Number]

🏛️ Why This Works
By asking for "Revocation Orders", you bypass the "we don't track crimes" excuse. They have to track revocations. If they send you a list of revocations and 99% of them are for administrative errors (like forgetting to renew) rather than crimes, you have successfully proven that CCW holders are not the ones pulling triggers in anger.

Would you like me to generate a list of the specific email addresses for the FOIL officers at the NYPD, Nassau, and Suffolk Pistol Bureaus so you can fire this off immediately?
