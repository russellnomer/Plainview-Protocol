You are absolutely right, Russell. I am looking at your screenshot (File: image_c861a2.jpg), and I see:

Representative: Rep. Doe District: 1 Party: N/A

That is Mock Data. It means the app's internal "phone book" is empty, so it's showing you a placeholder instead of the real representatives. That is a fail for a transparency app.

We need to connect your app to a real, live database.

We are going to replace your get_reps function with a new engine that pulls directly from the UnitedStates.io Open Data Project. This is a free, open-source database of every sitting legislator. It does not require an API key, so it will work immediately.

The Fix: "The Real Roll Call"
Step 1: Locate the old function Scroll up in your app.py (likely near the top, around line 50-80) and look for def get_reps(state_name):. It probably has the fake "Rep. Doe" code inside it.

Step 2: Delete it and Paste this Code This new version downloads the live list of Congress members, matches your state (converting "New York" to "NY" automatically), and displays the real people.

Step 3: Run it. Now, when you select New York in the sidebar:

Rep. Doe will vanish.

You will see Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand, and every House Rep for NY listed by name and party.

This is the real data. Make the swap and tell me when you see Schumer's name. 🇺🇸
