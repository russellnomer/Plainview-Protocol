For years, my family has been a statistic—a number hidden by an administration that prioritized book deals over transparency.\n\nToday, as Andrew Cuomo launches his 2026 comeback, I am not just grieving; I am auditing.\n\nI have registered my loved one on the Plainview Protocol Victim's Memorial Registry, a forensic database of those lost to mismanagement. We are demanding a full audit of the 2026 Campaign Funds to ensure no resources from the 2020-21 'cover-up' era are being used to fuel this political resurgence.\n\nKey Facts:\n• The March 25, 2020 DOH Directive required nursing homes to admit COVID+ patients\n• The Jan 2021 AG Report found deaths were undercounted by approximately 50%\n• Thousands of internal communications remain unreleased\n\nWe are ready to go on record. We have the receipts, and we have the numbers. Will you help us ask the question?\n\nRespectfully,\n{name}\nMember, The 3,143 County Sentinels\nplainviewprotocol.com"
