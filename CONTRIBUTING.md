# Contributing to The Plainview Protocol

## Mission Statement

**Founded on January 8, 2026, by Russell Nomer as a tool for modern sovereignty.**

The Plainview Protocol is an open-source citizen oversight platform designed to bring transparency to government at all levels. We welcome contributions from anyone who shares our commitment to Truth, Kindness, and Security.

## Core Principles

1. **Bipartisan Scrutiny** - We apply equal scrutiny to Red and Blue jurisdictions. Transparency is a fiduciary duty, not a partisan choice.

2. **Data-Driven** - All claims must be backed by verifiable sources (government APIs, public records, official documents).

3. **Citizen Empowerment** - Features should help ordinary citizens hold officials accountable through legal means.

4. **Decentralization** - The Protocol is designed to be forked. Each fork is a new node in the transparency network.
